IP4M: An integrated platform for mass spec-trometry-based metabolomics data analysis

With the rapid evolution and broad application of metabolomics, there is greater dependency on the use of bioinformatic tools. A number of free or commercial, desktop or web-based, separate or comprehensive tools have been actively reported. However, there is still an unmet demand for a transparent, full-function, and user-friendly platform. 

Here, an integrated platform for mass spec-trometry-based metabolomics data analysis (IP4M) was developed, which covers almost all the steps of metabolomics data analysis, such as peak identification and annotation, raw data and peak table preprocessing, difference analysis, correlation analysis, cluster and sub-cluster analysis, linear regression analysis, pathway and enrichment analysis, ROC analysis, Venn analysis, sample size and power analysis, and many others. The integrated functions and packages were selected from numer-ous popular or standard ones. 

The strengths of IP4M are comprehensive supports to usual steps, many functions for extended analysis, rich knowledgebase, and options for customizable operations and integrated workflows. Currently, IP4M is a local application considering the heavy burden of big raw data uploading and data privacy. In the near future, some of the modules will be moved to an online platform.

IP4M, co-developed using Java, Perl and R, is friendly for beginners and advanced users and is an attractive tool for computational metabolomics.

Administrator privileges are required for IP4M launching.
